Here is the source code for a basketball game created with Unity3D. Open the project, inside of Player_01 is a script called "Movement" where you can choose between WASD (keyboard), a Gamepad (Dualshock controller, etc), or touch screen control options. The code is messy but its a decent start to get the hang of kinematic equations. This YT video was helpful for me to learn about kinematic equations! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvT8hjy6q4o
